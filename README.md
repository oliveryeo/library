Welcome to my TOP Library Javascript Project! This layout is inspired by michalosman's TOP Library project.

## <u>How to use?<u>
- There are three example book cards already loaded into the library once the website is loaded. 
- Adding a new book:
  - Select "+ Add book" to add a new book card into the library display.
  - A dialog modal should pop up, allowing you to fill in the necessary fields in the form.
  - The form will not submit if the information is incomplete.
  - You are allowed to cancel the submission of the form if you do not want to submit a new book card.
- Modifying the book card's read status or removal
  - Press on the read status button to change to "Not read" or "Read".
  - To remove the card, just select the "Remove" button of the book card.
